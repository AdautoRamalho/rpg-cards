Rakh’Amun era membro de uma ordem de aventureiros e heróis conhecidos por desafiar os perigos das terras selvagens e guiar os viajantes com segurança, (história DC 20) mas ele encontrou seu fim nas mãos dos exércitos de uma nobre família conhecida como os <strong>Criadores de Rios</strong>, cuja ganância e domínio sobre os caminhos fluviais os levou a temer a popularidade e a influência de Rakh’Amun entre o povo.</p>\n<p>O espírito da lâmina, conhecido como <strong>M’Jarek</strong> (véu DC 16 ou história DC 24) – um guardião dos viajantes – foi vinculado à arma por juramento, leal a Rakh’Amun mesmo após a morte. Ao pronunciar o nome do espírito, <strong>M’Jarek</strong> manifesta-se em uma lâmina espiritual invisível olhos comuns não podem ver, mantendo a lealdade de proteger e jamais atacar inocentes. <strong>M’Jarek</strong> é sábio e honra o vínculo antigo que o liga ao espírito do herói.</p>\n<p>Este cabo de espada não é meramente uma arma, mas um símbolo dos sacrifícios feitos por aqueles que desafiaram o poder e a corrupção, carregando consigo as lembranças e o juramento de um espírito que se recusa a descansar enquanto o nome do herói ecoa na história de Althaner.</p>\n</blockquote>",
